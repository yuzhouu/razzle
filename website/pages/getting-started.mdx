# Getting Started

## Quick Start

```sh
npx create-razzle-app@canary my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app. Your console should look like this:

**That's it**. You don't need to worry about setting up multiple webpack configs or other build tools. Just start editing `src/App.js` and go!

## Razzle has many examples, we might have one that fits your needs

See: [The examples](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/master/examples)

## Commands

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### npm start

Runs the project in development mode.
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

By default this uses NODE_ENV=production and asks if you want to run it.

If you nont want the confirmation add --noninteractive to your build command.

If you want to use a different env file e.g. .env.something-staging file you can add --node-env=something-staging

### npm run start:prod

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### npm test

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### npm export

Exports a static version of the application in production mode. Must add the `export` command to `package.json`'s scripts along with a `static_export.js` file in the `src` directory. See [Static Site Generation](https://razzlejs.org/docs/static-export/) for more details.

### rs

If your application is running, and you need to manually restart your server, you do not need to completely kill and rebundle your application. Instead you can just type `rs` and press enter in terminal.

## Dependencies

To make sure razzle is installed properly make sure razzle peerdependencies are installed, run:

```bash
yarn add razzle razzle-dev-utils babel-preset-razzle webpack-dev-server@3.11.0 mini-css-extract-plugin@0.9.0 --dev
```

Choose your webpack version

```bash
yarn add webpack@5.16.0 --dev
# or
yarn add webpack@4.46.0 --dev
```

Also if there are issues, try adding specific package versions to resolutions in `package.json`.

## Common problems

If you have issues with css this might be related to postcss being resolved wrong.

To fix this add:

```json
{
  "postcss": "8.2.4"
}
```

To resolutions in your package.json. For npm see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52416312/npm-equivalent-of-yarn-resolutions).

## Debugging with Inspector

- `npm start -- --inspect=[host:port]` or `yarn start --inspect=[host:port]` This will start the node server and enable the inspector agent. The `=[host:port]` is optional and defaults to `=127.0.0.1:9229`. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

- `npm start -- --inspect-brk=[host:port]` or `yarn start --inspect-brk=[host:port]` This is the same as `--inspect`, but will also break before user code starts. (to give a debugger time to attach before early code runs) For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

- `npm test -- --inspect=[host:port]` or `yarn test --inspect=[host:port]` This will start the tests server and enable the inspector agent. The `=[host:port]` is optional and defaults to `=127.0.0.1:9229`. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-tested/).

- `npm test -- --inspect-brk=[host:port]` or `yarn test --inspect-brk=[host:port]` This is the same as `--inspect`, but will also break before user code starts. (to give a debugger time to attach before early code runs) For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).
